## Quick Start
1. Clone this repository to your machine or download the zip of the code.
2. Open the folder you downloaded or cloned in a IDE or "Text Editor" like VSCode.
3. Open the index.html in your browser of choice (recommended Chrome)
4. Read the problems on the website shown and complete the empty functions in the file logic.js.
5. Press the "Test Problem X" buttons to check your solutions.
6. (Optional) If you're using VSCode download the extension Live Server and start the live server, this will refresh the webpage and thus check your solutions when you save your amended code.

### Future Goals
- Add more questions
- Allow writing code in the browser
- More language capabilities
